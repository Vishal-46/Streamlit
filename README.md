# 🚀 Streamlit Learning Journey 🚀

Welcome to my Streamlit notes repository! This is where I'm documenting my journey learning Streamlit, the awesome Python library for building interactive web apps.

## 💡 What is Streamlit?

Streamlit lets you turn Python scripts into shareable web applications in minutes. No front-end experience required! ✨

## 📝 Notes Overview

This repo also includes the `main.py` file, which contains some example Streamlit code.


This repo contains my personal notes, code snippets, and key takeaways as I explore Streamlit. Expect to find:

*   **Fundamentals:** Basic syntax, data display, and layout options.
*   **Widgets:** Sliders, buttons, text inputs, and other interactive elements.
*   **Caching:** Optimizing performance with Streamlit's caching mechanisms.
*   **Deployment:** Tips and tricks for deploying your Streamlit apps.

## 🧭 How to Use This Repo

Feel free to browse these notes, copy code snippets, and adapt them for your own Streamlit projects. This is a living document, so expect updates and improvements as I learn more!
